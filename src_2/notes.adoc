* Can stream offset be positive?
** I don't like the idea of accessing future values, it messes with cycles but may be possible?
** This is because if we use the future value of an old input we can just buffer everything, but then we'd be running a deficit we'd need to catch up?
** It could also be possible via re-balancing the tree, however it could behave weirdly if the rebalance extends into an input stream?
** I can't actually think of a situation where you'd want to use next rather than previous though...
